## What is the difference between a [database]{.vonrestoff} and a [repository]{.vonrestoff}? {.center}

## {#slide2-id data-menu-title="Repositories and Databases" .center}

1. Repository[*]{.highlight} a location where data is stored and managed
2. Database[*]{.highlight} a collection of structured[*]{.highlight2} information
3. Therefore a database can also be a repository, but a repository isn't necessarily a database.

[[*]{.highlight}These are not a universally agreed definitions.]{.small}<br>
[[*]{.highlight2}Structured means that data is organised in a way that machines can read it. Such as using common identifiers across items. Unstructured means there is no formalised way to relate objects to one another even if they are related.]{.small}

## What is the simplest way to create a database? {.center}

## Use a [plain text file]{.vonrestoff} such as a comma separated variable file (.csv){.center}

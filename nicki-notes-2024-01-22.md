Topics on my 'seek DS expertise' list:

1. initial question that I was meant to ask is if DS have capacity to help create a Learning Object repository. If your expert recommendation is to use a spreadsheet, we can create that and come to DS for visualisation of the data

2. Feedback. This divides into a couple of strands
feedback/analytics: are students using our LOs? Can we tell from analytics if they are finding them useful (if someone watches 3 seconds of a video before leaving the page then probably not). Who has responsibility for tracking and visualising this data and ensuring that it's being used effectively. My notes say "ask DS what they can do re feedback analytics". What can we capture from different software (Panopton, LibGuides, Wordpres, Articulate, Thinglink)
gathering feedback from students about how useful they found a resource (Ikea smiley faces etc). Incorporate best practice guidance into the LO creation toolkit

What's the difference between a database and a repository?* *These are not a universally agreed definitions

1. Repository: a location where data is stored and managed
2. Database: a collection of structured information.
3. Therefore a database can also be a repository, but a repository isn't necessarily a database.

Structured means that data is organised in a way that machines can read it, such as using common identifiers across items. 

Unstructured means there is no formalised way to relate objects to one another even if they are related.

What's the simplest way to create a database?

1. Store your data flat files
2. What's a flat file?
4. And why not Excel?
5. Make it tidy.
6. Tidy data mean in a table:
  - Each column is a variable e.g. name, date_of_creation,
  - Each row represents a set of observed variables
  - Each value has it's own cell
7. A database can be a collection of tables linked by shared variables (structured data)

Feedback and analytics

What is the purpose?

LibGuides, Wordpress and Articulate are linked to Google Analytics

A wealth of information:

- Per page: number of views, users, unique users and average engagement time over period defined
- Summary of user demographics: country, city and language. Number of users and avg. enagagement time.
- Tech: browser name, desktop, mobile or tablet.

- Panopto: views, unique views, video duration and avg. watch time
- Thinglink: views, unique views, tag views and clicks (export is for profile, so you then have to post process for a specific creation)

In summary then, you can assess number of views over time, where people are viewing from and
how long they engage.

However, without a baseline one can't infer the relative quality of learning objects.

Feedback with diagnostic power.

What don't you get that you might want?

- Whether they learnt anything?
- Whether they enjoyed it?
- How to improve it?

Feedback on your feedback ideas

Back to my A-levels...the Hawthorne effect.

Abraham Wald has entered the chat... (selection bias)

Lots of search results claim feedback matters, but no evidence to support this
assertion.

Focus on what people do rather than what they say

Creat a minimu

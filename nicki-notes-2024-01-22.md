# Nicki's notes

Topics on my 'seek DS expertise' list:

1. initial question that I was meant to ask is if DS have capacity to help create a Learning Object repository. If your expert recommendation is to use a spreadsheet, we can create that and come to DS for visualisation of the data

2. Feedback. This divides into a couple of strands
feedback/analytics: are students using our LOs? Can we tell from analytics if they are finding them useful (if someone watches 3 seconds of a video before leaving the page then probably not). Who has responsibility for tracking and visualising this data and ensuring that it's being used effectively. My notes say "ask DS what they can do re feedback analytics". What can we capture from different software (Panopton, LibGuides, Wordpres, Articulate, Thinglink)
gathering feedback from students about how useful they found a resource (Ikea smiley faces etc). Incorporate best practice guidance into the LO creation toolkit

What's the difference between a database and a repository?

1. Repository: a location where data is stored and managed
2. Database: a collection of structured information.
3. Therefore a database can also be a repository, but a repository isn't necessarily a database.

What's the simplest way to create a database?

1. Create a flat file database.
2. What's a flat file?
4. And why not Excel?
5. Make it tidy.
6. Tidy data mean in a table:
  - Each column is a variable e.g. name, date_of_creation,
  - Each row represents a set of observed variables
  - Each value has it's own cell
7. A database can be a collection of tables linked by shared variables

- Whether they enjoyed it?
- How to improve it?

Feedback on your feedback ideas

Back to my A-levels...the Hawthorne effect.

Abraham Wald has entered the chat... (selection bias)

Lots of search results claim feedback matters, but no evidence to support this
assertion.
